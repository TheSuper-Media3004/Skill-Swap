# SkillSwap

SkillSwap is a peer-to-peer platform designed to democratize learning by allowing users to trade skills instead of money. Think of it like a barter system but for knowledge—you teach someone what you know, and they teach you something they know in return. 

I built this as a comprehensive full-stack project to solve a common problem: people want to learn new skills but often find courses or tutors too expensive. SkillSwap removes the financial barrier by matching individuals who have complementary skills and goals.

## Core Features

- **Skill Matching:** Users set up their profiles with the skills they can teach and the skills they want to learn. The platform helps match them with ideal learning partners.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Once matched, users can communicate instantly through an integrated live chat system to schedule their sessions and share resources.
- **No-Currency System:** The entire platform operates on the principle of direct skill exchange. No payment gateways, no subscription fees—just pure knowledge transfer.
- **Secure Authentication:** Complete user registration and login system ensuring that profiles and conversations remain private.
